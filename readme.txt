== Description ==



A bold green WordPress theme, excellent for a business or nonprofit website.  Its continuing mission, to boldly go where no green has gone before!  "Boldly Go Green" is a child theme by Jesse Smith of [Mardesco] (http://www.mardesco.com/).  It requires the parent theme, [Stargazer] (http://wordpress.org/themes/stargazer) by Justin Tadlock.

Pinstripes aren't your thing? It's easy to remove them and show off the tasteful bright green solid background color.  The theme package also includes some alternate green background images that you can select if you prefer.



== Installation ==

1. Install the parent theme, "Stargazer," from the WordPress repository.  You can use the "browse themes" auto-installer in your site's wp-admin, or you can upload the theme manually to your '/wp-content/themes' directory.  
2. Install the "Boldly Go Green" child theme to your 'wp-content/themes/' directory in the same manner.  
3. Activate "Boldly Go Green" using the link provided on your theme administration screen.
4. Don't forget to set up your navigation menus.
5. Have fun!
